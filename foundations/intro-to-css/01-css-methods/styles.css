/* I  missed font-weight in all three lines of the exercise. However, I found a way to avoid this mistake moving forward. Open solution/solution.html. Highlight the text in question. Right click and select inspect. Google Chrome's development tools will confirm if my future guesses for font-weight are correct. Hopefully I'll be better at eyeballing it as I progress further in the course.*/
